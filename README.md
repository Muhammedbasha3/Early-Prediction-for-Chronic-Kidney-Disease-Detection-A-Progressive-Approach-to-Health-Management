Early Prediction for Chronic Kidney Disease Detection: A Progressive Approach to Health Management
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated in the early stages. Usually, people are not aware that medical tests we take for different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney diseases.
Chronic kidney disease includes conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy by filtering wastes from your blood.
If kidney disease worsens, wastes can build to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick.
37 million American adults have CKD, and millions of others are at increased risk
Early detection can help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure
Heart disease is the primary cause of death for all people with CKD
